# Tower
Hydropnic_Tower
	This is a hydroponic tower I printed and built on my 3D printers. The generic tower was obtained from..., but I added modifications to meet my needs. This included a modification of the pail cover, lamp support posts, the addition of a control box, and several containers for individual sensors and controls.
	This is a work in progress, my first attempt at a github, and will slowly be adding the files over the next several weeks, so please excuse the sparcity of information at this point.
